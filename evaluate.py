#1) load the json file from the input and see what was the original instruction/goal
#2) load all the json files under results_dir and get all the questions, and the DS they belong and the evolv-instruct method used to build them (if any). Then put this info in a dataframe
#3) iterate over the dataframe for all the questions and pass it to an LM with the prompt that it has to evaluate the quality of the question from 1 to 10 taking into account the original instruction/goal
#4) do some visualizations of the resulting evaluations and put the best questions in a new json file
